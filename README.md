# H1Bclassification
H1B Classification Project (Final Project of Summer 2018 Stats 101C at UCLA)

## Abstract

H-1B VISA, being described by Dr. Michio Kaku as the “secret weapon that suck up all the brains from the world”, is certainly one of the most crucial thing for every international student who decide to work or even stay in the United States. However, while most of the applicant of H-1B VISA gets Approved, a lot of applicants still get rejected. This project aims to explore potential factors that undermine and boost the probability of approval.
